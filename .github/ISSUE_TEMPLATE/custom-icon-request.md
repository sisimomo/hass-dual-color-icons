<!--If there is a specific icon from the MDI or HUE icon set that you would like to have in a dual-color format, please let me know, and I will make an effort to create it for you and include it in this pack. If you are able to create it yourself, that would be even better!-->

**Provide a URL that points to the original icon to add a dual color look to it**

<!--I will need the exact SVG file of the icon to create a dual-color version. So please provide the Url to the SVG file of the icon. Example: https://github.com/Templarian/MaterialDesign/blob/master/svg/vanity-light.svg or https://github.com/arallsopp/hass-hue-icons/blob/main/docs/custom_svgs/adore.svg-->

**Additional context**

<!--Add any other context for your icon request here.-->
